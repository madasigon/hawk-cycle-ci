# Tear down a Hawk deployment — the teardown analogue of preflight.sh.
#
# `pulumi destroy` alone does not cleanly tear down a protected stack: pulumi
# protect flags refuse the destroy at preview, the ALB has deletion protection,
# versioned S3 buckets and ECR repos are created without force_destroy /
# force_delete, and Karpenter NodeClaims can hang the destroy indefinitely when
# their nodes hold pods that refuse eviction. This script automates the working
# sequence:
#
#   1. Set hawk:protectResources=false and run `pulumi up`, which removes the
#      deletion guards declaratively (protect flags, ALB deletion protection,
#      S3 force_destroy, ECR force_delete) in one pass.
#   2. Uninstall node-dependent helm releases (gpu-operator) while their nodes
#      still exist, then drain Karpenter capacity with a bounded wait,
#      force-finalizing stuck NodeClaims (terminate the EC2 instance, clear the
#      finalizer) so the destroy never blocks on them.
#   3. `pulumi destroy`, tolerating a stale/unreachable EKS provider; retries
#      up to 3 times, riding out a timed-out helm uninstall and auto-dropping
#      helm releases that such an uninstall removed in-cluster without
#      recording in pulumi state.
#   4. `pulumi stack rm`.
#   5. Print the manual bootstrap cleanup steps that live outside the stack
#      (Pulumi state bucket, KMS key, Route 53 public zone, parent-DNS
#      delegation).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev/teardown.sh [--yes] <stack>
#
#   --yes   skip the interactive stack-name confirmation (unattended runs)
#
# Environment:
#   NODECLAIM_TIMEOUT  Seconds to wait for NodeClaims to drain before
#                      force-finalizing them (default: 300).
#
# Do not pipe this script through `tee` — it masks non-zero exit codes.
